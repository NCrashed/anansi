A graph manipulation library for the D Programming Language. Heavily inspired, possibly to the point of plaigiarism, but the boost graph library. At present Anansi implements only the tiniest subset of the BGL, but it should be at least at a point where it can be easily added to.

This first pass will probably be a pretty simple translation of (bits of) the BGL into D. The second pass will hopefully transform it into something more like idiomaitic D.

** As-yet-unasked Questions: **

Q: Why another graph handling library?
A: Licensing, and it seemed like an interestingthing to do.

Q: Why "Anansi"?
A: Webs, trickster gods. 

If you think "anansi" is a silly name then you're probably right, but always rememer that things could be worse. It's original name was "spiderpig".

Q: Why is your D basically C++ with subtly different syntax?
A: For no reason other than I know C++ better than D, and don't know the idiomatic D way to do a lot of things yet.
